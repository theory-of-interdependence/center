# The Theory of Interdependence: Center
The center is the most abstracted portion of the theory. It is limited to only the premises which are foundational and therefore found within all outward radiating works.

## Constraints
The center constraints define the rules upon which the Theory of Interdependence rests. Detailed explanations of each constraint may be updated over time for improvement, clarification, and increased accuracy.

### The universe is an information system
For a human being to perceive anything, regardless of its source or nature, requires representation of the thing in the form of neurological signals. Neurological signals are information. They are comprised of differences in energy amounts arranged in formation.

### Everything is part of the universe
If it can be named, described, pointed to directly, or perceived then it is part of the universe. An expanded universe concept includes thoughts, memories, consciousness, ideas, dreams, and feelings in addition to the physical universe of particles, atoms, molecules, cells, minerals, empty space, and electromagnetic radiation. A precise replay of the neurological signals representing a plastic ballpoint pen cannot be distinguished from the original perception of the pen. Thoughts and other non-physical objects must be included in the universe because physical objects are represented as non-physical objects when perceived.

### The structure of human perception and the structure of the universe are inseperable

### The limits of human perception as greater than previously known
The limits of human perception are defined as the entire set of perceptive capabilities understood to be accessible to at least one human being over the course of recorded history. The known limits of human perception are incorrect. The limits of human perception known by an individual person are incorrect because only a single other person with knowledge of any additional human perceptive capabilities is required to prove that is true. Proving that it is not true requires a survey of the entire body of knowledge of all humanity regarding human perception and regularly updated interview records for every living person on the planet. The limits of human perception known by the entire human population are incorrect because the definition of that knowledge is the survey and interviews previously referenced and those do not exist. The ultimate limits of human perception are beyond the collectively known limits because that is true provided that at least one additional perceptive capability of humans is added to the list at any point in the future up until the last heartbeat of the last human being.
